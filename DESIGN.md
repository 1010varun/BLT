This file is to keep track of Design Changes contributed by the community.  Add a description of your design change here with a link to your figma file.  We will then review and merge into our main figma file https://www.figma.com/file/s0xuxeU6O2guoWEfA9OElZ/Bugheist-Full-Design

Fred: I have organized the file a bit to make it all fit on one page.  It still needs to be converted 100% into Figma, most of the screens are screenshots.  - https://www.figma.com/file/s0xuxeU6O2guoWEfA9OElZ/Bugheist-Full-Design?node-id=0%3A1

The design files are here by the way for PDF - if someone can convert them into figma that would save a lot of time: it seems it can be done by opening in photoshop, save as pdf, open in sketchn then export to figma.  Here is the main design issue to keep track of tasks https://github.com/OWASP/BLT/issues/696
